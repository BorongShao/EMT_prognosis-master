# EMT prognostic signatures

Data and code for the manuscript

Shao, Borong, et al. "EMT network-based feature selection improves prognosis prediction in lung adenocarcinoma." bioRxiv (2018): 410472.

In the folder 'feature selection algorithms' we put the R code of the feature selection algorithms. Some are from the original studies and some are implemented by us. In the folder 'NoNetwork' we put the code for the feature selection algorithms that do not employ biological networks. 

In the folders 'TCGA data' and 'Test data' we put the molecular and clinical data for cross-validation and independent testing. 

In the folder 'experiments' we put the code that evaluates different feature selection algorithms. This includes 30 times 10-fold cross-validation, survival analysis, association rule mining, etc. 

In the 'network files' folder, we put the nodes and edges of the 3 EMT networks.
